Marketing Campaigns are the foundation of every opportunity, serving as a driving force behind effective growth.

These step-by-step instructions go over how to set up a Marketing Campaign to track your ROI on particular marketing events such as the annual AWS re:Invent.

Once you have saved your new Marketing Campaign, a panel at the bottom of the screen will become available where you can complete the setup.

* Enter the `Budget` cost
* Enter the expected `Revenue`
* **Optional** Select a default `Track` from the drop down menu
 > `Tracks` can be used to automate many things over a set duration of time. A good track to use in this case would be one that automatically creates `activities` for the `account manager` one week after sending out bulk emails.
* Click `Save`

### Step Four: Open Marketing Manager
